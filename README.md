## Missing Images

The webpage includes functional redirecting links, but the images are not displayed because the original file paths were local to the development system. 

### Steps to Restore Images:

1. **Add the Required Images:**
   Upload all required images to a folder named `images` in the root directory of this project.

2. **Update Image Paths in HTML:**
   Replace the current local file paths in the HTML code with relative paths that point to the `images` folder. For example:

   <img src="Downloads/EBay_logo.png" alt="eBay Logo">

   The redirecting links and the rest of the webpage functionality remain unaffected.
